## Problem Statement
This problem is the extended version of AdevntureWorks_Store_Sales where data includes new additions like -
1. Purchasing
2. Employees
3. Product

- When the bikes, bike components sold on AdventureWorks via internet or store, AdventureWorks purchases products from Vendors that they either resell or use as component in their own finished goods that they build and sell.
- The deliverables are designed to represent the Purchasing Data Warehouse, populate the tables using Talend & Alteryx into the databases MySQL & SQL Server and then to create visualizations using Tableau, PowerBI
